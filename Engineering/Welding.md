## Types Of Welding

### [[Oxy-Acetylene]]
Oxy-Acetylene or "Oxy-Flame" Welding utilises a high heat, high temperature flame produced by burning a fuel gas mixture of pure oxygen and Acetylene, referred to as "**Oxy-Acetylene**, the Oxygen to Fuel Ratio can be adjusted to alter the Heat and power of the flame, the higher the Oxygen to fuel ratio is the more powerful the flame wil be.

### [[MIG]]
Gas Metal Arc, or Metal Inert Gas, (MIG) Welding refers to a type of welding where  a continuous spooled [[Solid Wire Electrode]] is pushed out of the nozzle, and a Arc jumps from it, to the metal being welded, 

### [[Electric Arc]] / **Stick Welding**
Electric Arc welding works off the principle that electricity (either AC or DC) travelling through the air from one conductor to another, they create a very intense and concentrated heat. this heat can get up to 3500°C to 400°C, the

### [[Plasma Cutting]]
Plasma cutting involves firing hot beams of plasma to cut metal, it can also be used to welb it together in a process called Plasma Welding
