How does the light a plant is exposed to effect it's growth

### Blue Light
Blue light will cause the plant to grow higher prior to growing fruit,  as the blue light assists in the manufacture of chlorophyll, as blue light is the easiest to absorb

### Red Light
Red light has the lngest wave-length which stimulates flowering over growth of the plant itself

### Green Light
Green light, as evident by the colour of the leaves, is mostly reflected and therefore not absorbed and turned into energy by photosynthesis, meaning the plant will likely struggle to survive or even die when exposed to solely green light.
