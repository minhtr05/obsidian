Formula
$$\text{Residual} = \text{Observed Value}  - \text{Predicted Value}$$
The **residual** is the difference of the Actual Value, compared to what a [[Regression Line]] predicts.

Copy Residual to list 3 to end up w/ the residual for each value in the list 3 next to it

### Residual Plot
A Residual plot is made by plotting the value of the residual, e.g.
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Observed = 15,5</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Predicted = 15,4</mark>
>$\text{Residual}=5-4 =1$


Plot 1 onto the y axis, keep it on the same x axis as it was.
>Plotted Residual = 15,1

#### Determining If Linear Model is appropriate
A Pattern that is easily visible means that the linear model is not appropriate. If the ![[mathregressionplots.png]]
