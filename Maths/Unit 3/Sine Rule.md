Used to **find** missing ***sides*** **and** missing ***Angles*** on triangles that do not have a **Right Angle**

**Formula**
>(Best For Missing Angles)
$$\frac{sinA}{a}=\frac{sinB}{b}=\frac{sinC}{c}$$
> (Best For Missing Side)
$$\frac{a}{sinA}=\frac{b}{sinB}=\frac{c}{sinC}$$
> In Both Scenarios Little a represents an side. and big A represents a angle as shown in the image below.

Opposite a specific letter is the lowercase of that letter, e.g. side C is opposite to angle c.
