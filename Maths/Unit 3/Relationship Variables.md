### Exp/Res Variables

#### Explanatory Variable
The Explanatory variable is having an effect on the [[#Response Variable]] is plotted onto the X Axis when plotting Linear Relationships as graphs.

#### Response Variable
The Response Variable is being affected by the [[#Explanatory Variable]], e.g. Cost Of Houses is the **reponse variable** to the Number of Houses for sale. This is plotted on the Y Axis of graphs.

(E.V or R.V can be plotted anywhere on a [[Frequency Tables#Two-Way Frequency Tables|two way frequency table]])

### Correlation ≠ Causation
Just cause there is an assosciation between two variables does not mean that one variable *causes* the other.

>[!exq]- Icecream + Murders
>
There is a [[Correlation Coefficient]] of [[Linear Relationships#Types of Relationships|R = 0.82]] between two variables, Icecream Sold and Murder rate, does not mean selling less icecream will result in less Murders. The Underlying cause is *Temperature* as it affects both of them

##### Confouding Variable
The **Confounding variable** is the third factor that is impacting both variables. in the Icecream + Murders example this is Temperature, these to things are coincidental but are still not related, because [[[Relationship Variables#Correlation ≠ Causatio| Causation does not equal Correlation.n]]]

Q: A survey of a large number of cities revealed a high correlation between the number of police offices and the nuber of crimes commited.
Does this mean that more police Officers are causing more crimes to be commited? Dicuss.

A:
It does not make any snese to conclude that the number of olice officers would be causing more crimes to be commited,Cities with high crime rates would actually need higher numbers ofp olice officers. It is more than likely that both of these variables increase in increase in cities with higher populaitons, Lower Economic Status, and other possible [[#Confouding Variable|Lurking (Confounding)]] variables
