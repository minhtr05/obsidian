If the coefficient of determination is high, the,
1. The [[Regression Line|Least Squares Regression line]] is a good model for the data
2. The relationship between the variabes is strong.

The variation thats explaned in the [[Relationship Variables#Response Variable|Response Variable]] by the variation in the [[Relationship Variables#Explanatory Variable|Explanatory Variable]].

#### What should be discussed when using
- Strength
- If Linear model is appropriate
- % of [[Relationship Variables#Response Variable|Response]] variation explaiend by [[Relationship Variables#Explanatory Variable|Explanatory]] variation

Yes this model is appropriate, it represents 61% of the data.

>[!exq]- Question 2a - Calculate the coefficient of determination from Pearson's correlation coefficient if r= 0.6
?
$R=0.6$
Coefficient Of Determination = $r^2$
$0.6^2 = r^2$
$= 0.36$
>
B)
If r=-0.95
$r^2 = (-0.95)^2 = 0.90$

>[!exq]- Question 3 - If $r^2 = 0.88$, and the least squares regression line equation is: $SleepingTime = -9.2*age + 62.71$
A) Interpret the coefficient of determination
88% of variation in sleeping time is explained
**Calculate Pearson's [[Correlation Coefficient]]
$r = \sqrt{555}$ = $\sqrt{0.88}=-0.94$
>(Negative due to least square regression line having ve gradient)
