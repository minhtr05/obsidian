The Correlation Coefficient, usually referred to as "***R***" is a way of measuring [[Linear Relationships]]. It is [[#Calculating "*r*"|calculated using the classpad]]. The higher it is the "*stronger*" a relationship is, if it is negative the relationship correlation is also negative, resulting in the line going in the opposite direction as seen [[Linear Relationships#Examples|here]].

#### What should be discussed when using
- Form (linear/non-linear)
- Direction (positive/negatve)
- Strength (weak, moderate, strong)

$$r = 0.71$$
Meaning it is a [[Linear Relationships#Types of Relationships|Moderate Positive Relationship]].
