R is equal to the [[Relationship Variables#Correlation Coefficient|Correlation Coefficient]] of the graph, [[#Calculating "*r*"|this can be calculated using the classpad]], and gives a  concrete answer  to the type of Correlation as seen [[#Types of Relationships|below]].

## Types of Relationships

| Value of r      | What it means                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| r = 1           | Perfect Positive Correlation  |
| 0.7 < r < 1     | Strong Positive Correlation   |
| 0.5 < r ≤ 0.7   | Moderate Positive Correlation |
| 0.3 < r ≤ 0.5   | Weak Positive Correlation     |
| 0 ≤ r ≤ 0.3     | No Significant Correlation    |
| r = 0           | No Linear Correlation         |
| -0.3 < r ≤ -0   | No Significant Correlation    |
| -0.7 ≤ r < -0.5 | Moderate Negative Correlation |
| -1 < r < -0.7   | Strong Negative Correlation   |
| r = -1          | Perfect Negative Correlation                              |

### Direction Of Linear Relationships

If the value of "*R*" is positive, then the Linear relationship is going for Left to right, increasing as it gets further to the right. As The [[Relationship Variables#Explanatory Variable|Explanatory Variable]] Increases so does the [[Relationship Variables#Response Variable|Response Variable]].
When the value of "*R*" is negative, then the Linear Relationship graph goes from Left to Right, but the [[Relationship Variables#Explanatory Variable|Explanatory Variable]] and [[Relationship Variables#Response Variable|Response Variable]] Decrease the further to the right they go.
