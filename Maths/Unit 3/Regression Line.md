**Formula** of a regression line
$$y = ax+b$$
The Regression Line is a Line Of best fit, Plotting the line using "a" and "b"  from [[Correlation Coefficient#Calculating "*r*"|Calculating "r"]], this creates line of best fit on graph, ensuring that [[Relationship Variables#Exp/Res Variables|Exp/Res Variables]] are in their correct position (X/Y Respectively), In calculator E*x*planatory (**x**) = List 1, Response (**y**) = list 2

#### What should be discussed when using
- Gradient
- y-intercept
- relate to context

##### On
Regresion line of Y **on** X  is the normal regression line, {X as list 1, Y as list 2}
Regression line of X **on** Y is the inverse, {X as list 2, Y as list 1}

After Calculation:

since y = ax+b, substituiting in *a* ad *b* creates a linear line, this is the line of best fit ad can be plotted as seen below

*dont use the y intercept* (**b**)*, as this graph starts at 2* Find Value at "2" using Analyse --> Trace (make sure zoomed out to where point is otherwise domain error)
(*plot the new line of best fit)*)
