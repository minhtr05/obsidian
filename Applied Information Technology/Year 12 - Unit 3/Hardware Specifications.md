>[!example]- Examples of Units of Measure
>
Gigabyte – References the amount of space
>
Megapixel – Refeerences theamount of pixels of detail a camera intakes, the quality deteriates if the amount of pixels a image has is greater than the screen it is displayed on
>
PPI – Pixels Per Inch, refers to the density of pixels, it doesn't relate to resolution, for example a 4k smart phone has much higher PPI than a 4k TV since the same amount of pixels are stuffed into a much smaller space.
>
GHz - Gigahertz, refers to the amount of instructions a computer's processer can compute in a second
>
mAh - Milliamp hour, measures the energy capacitiy of a battery.
