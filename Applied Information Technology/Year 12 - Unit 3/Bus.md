Computer busses are like the "public transportation" for data, transferring it from one position to another.


##### Bus Width
A bus operates at a strict schedule, picking up and dropping off data at regular intervals measured in hertz. e.g. 1 Hertz is one data transfer per second, 2 MHz or Megahertz is 2 million data transfers per second this is referred to as the bus width.

##### Address Bus
The address bus refers to how many bits of information can be addressed in memory, e.g. a 32-bit **Address Bus** can address 4**GB** of memory, or a 36-bit **Address Bus** can address 64**GB** of memory.

## Types of computer buses

There are twfo properties a bus must have,

- **Internal** vs. **External** bus

- **Parallel** bus vs. **serial** bus

#### Internal Bus vs. External Bus

##### Internal Bus
>Manages connections vs internal components, such as **video card** and **memory**.
##### External Bus
>Communicates with external **Peripherals**, e.g. USB or [[https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/scsi.htm |SCSI]] device.

#### Parallel bus vs. Serial Bus

##### Parallel Bus
>Data is transmitted several bits at a time
##### Serial bus
>Data is transferred one bit at a time.

### Bus Speed
Device speed is measured in MHz, e.g. 100 MHz, Where-as throughput is measured in bits per second or megabytes per second.
