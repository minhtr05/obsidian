The third-person objective narrative point of view abides by the same rules as first person narrative. The narrator operates like a camera and reports only things that the camera can see and hear. The difference is that the third-person narrator reports events using the third-person pronouns he, she, it and they rather than first-person pronouns. The narrator cannot interpret events; he can only report them.
