When an author uses the third-person omniscient narrative point of view, the narrator plays God. He is all-knowing and can comment on the thoughts and feelings of any of the characters. He can comment on any of the story's events and make judgments about them. With an omniscient point of view, it is possible to get into the head of more than one character rather than being limited to one.
