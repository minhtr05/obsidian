The third-person limited omniscient narrative point of view is like third-person omniscient. The only difference is that the limited omniscient point of view limits its knowledge to the thoughts, feelings and actions of just one character. The narrator can still comment on and judge the story's events. This narrative point of view allows identification with a particular character while being all-knowing in all other aspects.
