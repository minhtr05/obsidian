{Structural Choices}

Structural features are the organisational elements of a text.
They help structure a text in how it will work

E.g. Feature Articles use Headlines, Introductory Statements, several paragraphs exploring interrelating ideas in a [[Cause-and-effect Sequence]], Sub-headings, and a conclusion.

Or A Film may use an Opening Sequence, Title Screen, and [[Narrative Features]] such as exposition, rising action, climax, and resolution.
