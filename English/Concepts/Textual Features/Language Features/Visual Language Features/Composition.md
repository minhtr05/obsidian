Composition refers to the placement of elements within an image. 

E.g.
* Cameera Angle
* Placement along Horizontal or vertical plane
* Leading Line
* Vector
* Salience

### Camera Angle
| Feature                 | Meaning                                                                                                                                                  |

| Low Angle / Worm's eye  | Positions the viewer as looking up at the subject. Makes Subject appear powerful, Dominant, Unstoppable, Can make viewer feel Powerless                  |
| Oblique                 | Refers to an image that is capured on an angle.                                                                                                          |

### Shot Type

| Feature                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Close-up / Extreme Close-up | Close-ups force the viewer to get up close and personal with the subject; Extreme close-ups can be confronting, forcing the viewer to focus on a particular detail of the subject.                                              |
| Establishing / Long-shot    | Positions the viewer far away from the subject. This can work to create emotional distance, or it may be used to reveal the subject's small stature in their environmnet.                                                       |
| Full / Medium shot          | Brings the subject closer to the viewer. In a full shot the subject fills the frame, whereas a medium shot only shows their torso and head. These are common techniques as they offer a detailed representation of the subject. |
