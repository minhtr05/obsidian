### Appeal to logic

**Logos**, or the appeal to logic, is one of the [[Modes of Persuasion]] with the means to appeal to the audiencesâ€™ sense of reason or logic. To use logos, the author makes clear, logical connections between ideas, and includes the use of facts and statistics. Using historical and literal analogies to make a logical argument is another strategy. There should be no holes in the argument, also known as logical fallacies, which are unclear or wrong assumptions or connections between ideas.
