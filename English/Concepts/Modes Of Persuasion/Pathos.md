#Persuasion 

### Appeal to Emotion

**Pathos**, or the appeal to emotion, is one of the [[Modes of Persuasion]] that means to persuade an audience by purposely evoking certain emotions to make them feel the way the author wants them to feel. Authors make deliberate word choices, use meaningful language, and use examples and stories that evoke emotion. Authors can desire a range of emotional responses, including sympathy, anger, frustration, or even amusement.
