### **Definition**
Textual Evidence is any piece of information found within the text that helps explain or support what is being said or done in the narrative.

Textual Evidence should be integrated into the writing like in the example, avoid "long quotes"

## Using Textual Evidence
* Direct Quotes from written or spoken texts
* paraphrasing
* descriptions of structural features or multimodal evidence
* excerpts from texts, which can be shown on a screen in oral presentations

###### Quotes should also be:
* Succint and Transcribed Accurately
* Smoothly incorporated into your own sentences (like in example below)
* Enclosed in quotation marks
* Contextualised appropriately
* Varied, reflecting a range of generic features.



### Example

**Extract**
"*I interpret that the novel is one for young adults or adolescents, given by the youth slang of 'OMG' and 'BFFs'. To me, this image shows the depth and complexity of the adolescent brain*" 

**Marker Analysis**
*Reference to 'youth slang' is well supported by written **textual** examples which are then related to the importance of the accompanying visual images.*
