Narratives are story, [[Narrative Point Of View]] is the position from which the story is told. [[Narrative Voice]] incorporates [[Narrative Point Of View]].

[[Narrative Point Of View]] + Choice Of Narrator + Language and Style = [[Narrative Voice]]

### Seperation of Author's Personal Voice and Narrative Voice

The voice of the author is not always the voice of the Narrator / Character, e.g. in [[Fiction]] a fictional characters voice may be different to the authors voice. E.g. a Charming Upbeat person can create the Narrative Fictional Voice of someone who is ideologically opposite.

## Narrative Point of View
N-POV, incorporates one or a combination of:

* First Person
Or told from the perspective of the one experiencing it, e.g. pronouns like "I", "We", "I Thought"
* Third-person
Told From the external point of view e.g. a Narrator
