#### Definition
The degree to which a country can produce goods and services which meet the [[International Competiveness#Test Of International Markets|Test Of International Markets]], while simultaneously maintaining and expanding the real incomes of its people over the long term.

#### My Definition
The degree to which a country can produce goods and services while simultaneously remaining competitive with the prices of other countries, and maintaing or even increasing the living standards of its people in the long-term.

## Key Determinents of International Competitiveness

>[!help]+ Diagram
>![[Econs.png]]

#### Government Policies

#### [[Relative Inflation Rates]]
A Difference in in inflation rates between countries can cause an inbalance in the **competitiveness** of International and Domestic *Goods or Services*.

>[!exq]- Example
>If Australia's Inflation is high, Domestic Firms must increase their prices, where-as International Firms do not, thereby resulting in more imports than buying domestically.
>
>This happens because [[Inflation]], while heavily impacting [[Exchange Rate|Exchange Rates]], is not 1:1

#### [[Productivity]]
Productivity, is a measure of how much output can be produced from a given output. In this context,
**How much GDP is produced for the hours worked** and is calculated by Dividing GDP by Number of worked hours.
$$GDP \div \text{ Hours Worked} = \text{Productivity}$$

The productivity of **domestic firms** relative to the *competeing* **Foreign Firms**, determines success in the **Global Market**.
> More Productivity = More Competitive
#### Real Unit Labour Cost
Real Unit Labour Cost measures reflects changes in a country's wages relative to its [[#Productivity]], it will fall if productivity rises, or if the cost of wages falls, since now the **Labour Cost** (in ***Real Unit Labour Cost***) is smaller

> >- Inverse relationship between ULC and Labour Productivity
>
ii. [[Instructional Verbs - Econs#Describe|Describe]] the overall trend in unit labour costs between 2020 and 2022.
>> In 2020 Unit Labour costs underwent a drop to around -9%, before bouncing up again in 2021 all the way to +15%, then stabilising at a higher point then were it began at 2.5%, to in 2022 being slightly lower than 5%
>
>iii. [[Instructional Verbs - Econs#Discuss|Discuss]] the effect of this change in unit labour costs on Australia's International Competitiveness
>> Near the beginning this sharp drop in Labour Costs would increase **International Competitiveness**, in reality however other countries would be experiencing similar phenononia in 2020, and the slowdown of the COVID-19 Pandemic would prevent this increased competitiveness from being of any help.
>> The Increase of Unit Labour Costs to 15% in 2021 from the initital 2.5% in 2019, and -9% in 2020, would cause a decrease in International Competitiveness as Productivity would decrease, making australia Less Internationally Competitive in the re-emerging global market.
>> And Finally the reduction to normal levels of **ULC** in 2022, from 15% to 4.8-ish Percent would increase International Competitiveness as Australia came back down to a more regular **ULC** value closer to the 2.5% in 2019.


#### [[Exchange Rate]]
Changes in the exchange rate change the price of **exports** & **imports**, currencies are weighted against multiple other major  currencies such as the **US Dollar** in the [[Trade-Weighted Index|Trade Weighted Index (TW)]], this includes **many currencies**, if the Real TWI falls then this implies an improvement in competitiveness, since the price of Australian Exports to voerseas buyers will fall.

E.g. If AUD falls in value, Australian exports are now cheaper to foreign buyers, while imports are more expensive to Australian Buyers, meaning **Less International Competitiveness**
