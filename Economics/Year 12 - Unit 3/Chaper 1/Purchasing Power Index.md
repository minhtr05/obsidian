Purchasing Power parity refers to the idea that the **smaeproduct should sell for the same price** in different countries, **once converted to a common [[Exchange Rate|exchange rate]]**.

Formula:
$$PPP=\frac{\text{Price Big Mac (in country of comparison currency)}}{\text{Price Big Mac (in USD)}}$$



Example
AUD (big mac): $6.70 AUD
USD (big mac): $5.15 USD
$$\frac{6.70}{5.15}=1.30$$
According to Big Mac Index, 1 USD = 1.30 AUD
