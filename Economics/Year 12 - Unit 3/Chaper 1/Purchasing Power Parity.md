Purchasing Power parity refers to the idea that the **same product should sell for the same price** in different countries **after converted to a common [[Exchange Rate|exchange rate]]**, this is a measure of [[International Competiveness]], if a currency is undervalued it is bad for importers in that economy, and good for exporters from that economy.

Formula:
$$PPP=\frac{\text{Price Big Mac (Local Currency)}}{\text{Price Big Mac (in USD)}}$$

Checking if Currency is under/overvalued
$$\text{\% over or under}=\frac{PPP-ER}{ER}*100$$

Purchasing power parity can be seen by comparing the price of two goods in different economies that have the same input costs, e.g. [[Products#Uniform Products|Uniform Products]] like, **Big Macs** or **Iphones**.

>[!exq]+ Example - **Big Mac Index**
>### Big Mac Index
>
AUD (big mac): $6.70 AUD
USD (big mac): $5.15 USD
>
 $\frac{6.70}{5.15}=1.30$
>
According to Big Mac Index, 1 USD = 1.30 AUD
>
Checking if currency is under/overvalued
$\% Under Valued = \frac{1.30-1.45}{1.45}*100 = -10.3\%$
>
If correctly valued, Big Mac (US) = $\frac{6.70}{1.45}=\$4.62\text{ Australian Dollars}$

>[!exq]+ ### Iphones Vs Ipads
>>[!example] Ipads - ***1USD = 1.43AUD***
>Australian Ipad: $469 *AUD*
American Ipad: $329 *USD*
$$PPP=\frac{469}{329}=1.43$$
**Interpreted** as: 1USD = 1.43AUD
>
>>
>
>>[!example] Iphones - ***1USD = 1.63AUD***
>Australian Iphone X: $1629 *AUD*
American Iphone X: $1000 *USD*
$$PPP=\frac{1629}{1000}=1.629$$
**Interpreted** as: 1 USD = 1.63 AUD
> 
> This difference in **Implied Purchasing Parity** shows us that apple may be taking advantage of the popularity of the Iphone in Australia and upcharging on the price.
