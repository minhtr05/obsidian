Purchasing Power parity refers to the idea that the **same product should sell for the same price** in different countries, **once converted to a common [[Exchange Rate|exchange rate]]**, this is a measure of [[International Competiveness]], if a currency is undervalued it is bad for importers in that economy, and good for exporters from that economy.

Formula:
$$PPP=\frac{\text{Price Big Mac (in country of comparison currency)}}{\text{Price Big Mac (in USD)}}$$

Checking if Currency is under/overvalued
$$\text{\% over or under}=\frac{PPP-ER}{ER}*100$$

>[!exq]+ Example
>### Big Mac Index
>
AUD (big mac): $6.70 AUD
USD (big mac): $5.15 USD
>
 $\frac{6.70}{5.15}=1.30$
>
According to Big Mac Index, 1 USD = 1.30 AUD
>
Checking if currency is under/overvalued
$\% Under Valued = \frac{1.30-1.45}{1.45}*100 = -10.3\%$
>
If correctly valued, Big Mac (US) = $\frac{6.70}{1.45}=\$4.62\text{ Australian Dollars}$
