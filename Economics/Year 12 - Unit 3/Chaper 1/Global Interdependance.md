## Australian Interdependance
Australia for example is an Econonomy who engages in [[Trade]], exporting lots of [[Products#Simple Transformed Manufacture (STM)|STM]] Products, e.g. Iron Ore, Coal, to fuel our econonomy to then import lots of [[Products#Elaborately transformed Manufacture (ETM)|ETM]] Products that are more complicated and we don't have the capability to build. Thus we have an Interdependance on these other economies to fuel our economy by buying our coal so that we can buy our [[Products#Elaborately transformed Manufacture (ETM)|ETM]] Products.
