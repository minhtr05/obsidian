GDP is the measure of the market value of all **final** goods within an economy. 

### Types Of GDP

#### Nominal GDP
Total Value of all goods and services produced at **current market prices**. This *does not* account for changes in prices caused by *inflation*.

#### Real GDP
Total Value of all goods and services produced at **constant prices**. Based on a certain "base year" or the previous year. This *accounts* for *inflation*, and produces a more accurate view of [[Economic Growth]].

#### Actual GDP
Real-time measurement of all outputs at any interval or any given time.  It demonstrates the existing state of business of the economy.

### Calculating GDP

#### Expenditure Approach
This method calculates GDP based on the [[Aggregate Expenditure]], it is the most common and is based on the money spent by Households (*C*), Investments by Households/Businesses (*I*), Government Spending (*G*), and the net money spent Overseas (*X-M*) with a negative representing a net leakage to overseas market, and positive being a gain.
###### Formula
$$GDP = C+I+G+(X-M)$$
*C* = Consumer Expenditure
*I* = Sum of Investments spent on Capital Equipment, Inventories, and Housing
*G* = Government Expenditure
(*X* - *M*) Net Exports, with *X* being **Exports** and *M* being **Imports**

#### Income Approach

#### Production Approach
