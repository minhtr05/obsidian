Inflation is the Rising cost of **Goods and Services** that regular households buy, and is measured by the [[Consumer Price Index|Consumer Price Index (CPI)]], which is based on a regular "basket of goods" that a traditional household is likely to buy. 

One of the causes for Inflation is an inbalance in the [[Supply Demand Curve]], if it is not at equilibrium it.

Target rate of **2-3%**

## Types of Inflaton

### Cost-Push
When the cost of **production** rises, firms usually push this ont the consumers in the form of higher prices on their products, this in turn increases the price of an "*average basket of goods*"

### Demand-Pull 
When demand is too high and there is a shortage of goods consumers tend to pull up prices as compete to gain access to these goods, thereby increasing inflation as it is measured by a "*basket of goods*"

### Supply Shock
Occurs when an event significantly interferes with the supply chain, *usually* resulting in [[Inflation#Cost-Push|Cost-Push Inflation]].
