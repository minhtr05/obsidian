Competitive markets are open, and fair. They have a large number of buyers and sellers to ensure no one buyer or seller has influence over the market.

Opposite to [[Imperfect Markets]], every participant in a **Competitive Market** is a "Price Taker", in that none of them have the [[Market Power]] to set the price as they would just be drowned out by the competition.
