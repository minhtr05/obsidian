The **Supply/Demand** Curve moves to the left if a [[Non-Price Factor]] *decreases* Overall Supply, Or to the right if it increases Supply, e.g. Supply Chain Issues moving Supply Curve, High unemployment moving Demand Curve left.

The Price will move along the demand curve following the same rules of Direction instead of **Shifting** if only price is changed, e.g. Producer increases prices above the equilibrium, 

e.g. Global Supply Chain Issues causes Supply curve to shift to the left as less supply is produced overall.
