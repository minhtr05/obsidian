Elasticity refers to how much consumers will react to a specific change in price.

E.g. Petrol is Inelastic, therefore an increase in the price of petrol will result in a smaller loss of demand.

Elasticity is represented by a number from -1 > 1, 
* <1 = Inelastic
* 1 = Unitary Elasticity
* 1> = Elastic
* âˆž = Perfectly Inelastic

Perfect Elasticity is purely theoretical, it is not possible for something to increase an infinite amount as a result of a 0.0000001 increase.

## Price Elasticity Of Demand
Price Elasticity Of Demand is the measurement of how responsive the amount of Quantity **Demanded** is to a change in **Price**
$$P_{ED}$$

$$\frac{\% \Delta Qd}{\% \Delta P} = P_{ED}$$
## Price Elasticity Of Supply
Price Elasticity Of Supply is the measurement of how responsive the quantity of a good supplied is to a change in price.
$$P_{ES}$$
$$\frac{\% \Delta Qs}{\% \Delta P}$$
## Income Elasticity Of Demand
Income Elasticity of demand is the measurement of how responsive the quantity of a god or service demanded is to a change in income.
$$Y_{ED}$$
$$Y_{ED}=\frac{\% \Delta Qd}{\% \Delta Y}$$
The Value a good scores on this determines if it is a Normal or Inferior Good.
