The Gini Coefficient is a value that is between 0 and 1, and is used as a measure of a countries Income Inequality.

The higher it is the more Inequal the economy it is representing is. It is based on the [[Lorenz Curve]], and when it is 0 is coincides with the "perfect Equality Line" which would be when every household has the exact same Income. The closer to one the **Gini Coefficient** gets the further the [[Lorenz Curve]] Moves towards the perfect Inequality line, at which one household has **100%** of the income.

Calculation Of **Gini Coefficient**
$$G = \frac{A}{A+B} $$

Note:
The Gini Coefficient is not suitable to compare countries Inequality due to differences in [[Equivalence Scales]].
